# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...



# Final Project

## The Problem



* The content which we ingest and broadcast online as a means to market ourselves is scattered among many social media applications. "Clever Name" application seeks to solve this problem as a centralized social media app that curates the content you'd like to broadcast and provide perspective on for your professional audience.

## Brainstorm/Initial Thoughts

* A social media application that displays a user's content(books, articles, etc.) that they want to broadcast to professionals (i.e. employers, influencers, colleagues, etc.)

* User will log in and have a profile that they can Create, Read, Update, and Destroy Content
    * Each piece of content will have a title, author/source, genre, and review
        * This will involve many-to-many relationships between data tables
            * This will require a cross reference table for each type of content

* User will be able to visit other user's profiles and view their content that they have generated

* Challenges/Roadblocks:
    * Learning and implementing Redux as a way to manage my applications state
        * Knowing when and if I will need to scrap this idea if it becomes apparent (by a set deadline) that this is not feasible for me to successfully implement
    * Incorporating an API call - likely to search for books to add to one's "bookshelf"
    * The differences in accessibility between Users as well as searching for other users
    * Webpack - how am I building this?
        * React Slingshot - will this be the best way for me to get a React/Redux app up and running quickly?
    * Using Ruby on Rails with React - will require a Gem file, which I've never done this before
        * Am I setting routes with Rails or React Router?

* At its core, this application is CRUD with auth, but with the intention of tapping into a purely professional audience.

## Proposal

* Cost - $75/hr while a Sprint is in progress

* Time - will have a functioning application on 1/29

* $$ to start - $2000

* Working Demo at end of first sprint - Monday, 1/22 there will be a working demo of the app.
    * Redux implementation to be decided upon by Saturday, 1/20

* Work schedule (Sprint schedule)
    * 1st Sprint from Thursday to Saturday afternoon (Redux learning)
    * 2nd Sprint from Monday to Wednesday
    * 3rd Sprint from Thursday to Sunday, with presentation Monday

* Other pay dates?? Another $2000 when it's complete

* Prototype/MVP/Done?
    * MVP is a CRUD app with users/auth using React/Redux/Rails
    * Completed app includes different capablity based on the user
